## Future Improvements
- There is currently a bug where if you delete a menu item before adding a new one, the id value of the item could be the same as an already existing id value. Looking to fix this ASAP
- In the Home page, I'd like to add a feature that allows the user to post new articles to depict any news they'd like to share (closing for a holiday, upcoming events, etc).
- The site needs better styling, I'm hoping to add more so that it looks a bit more presentable.
