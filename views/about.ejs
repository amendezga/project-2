      <h2>About Us</h2>
      McBurgies is a popular burger restaurant located in Springfield that was founded in 1985 by two friends, John McDonald and Bill Burgies. 
      John and Bill were passionate about creating a fun and welcoming environment where customers could enjoy high-quality burgers, fries, and shakes. 
      They began their venture with a small food truck, serving burgers and fries to locals. 
      Their delicious food and friendly service quickly gained a loyal following, and soon they were able to open their first brick-and-mortar location. 
      Over the years, McBurgies has continued to expand, with multiple locations throughout the city and a reputation for offering some of the best burgers in town. 
      Despite their growth, John and Bill have remained true to their original vision of creating a fun and inviting atmosphere where customers can enjoy a delicious meal with friends and family.
